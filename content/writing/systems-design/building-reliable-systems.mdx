Reliability isn't a feature you add at the end—it's a foundation you build from the start. After years of maintaining production systems, I've learned that reliable systems share common patterns.

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Fault Tolerance

Systems fail. Hardware fails, networks partition, dependencies go down. The question isn't *if* something will fail, but *when*.

```typescript
// Circuit breaker pattern example
class CircuitBreaker {
  private failures = 0;
  private readonly threshold = 5;
  private state: 'closed' | 'open' | 'half-open' = 'closed';

  async execute<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    if (this.state === 'open') {
      throw new Error('Circuit breaker is open');
    }

    try {
      const result = await fn();
      this.onSuccess();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.onFailure();
      throw error;
    }
  }

  private onSuccess() {
    this.failures = 0;
    this.state = 'closed';
  }

  private onFailure() {
    this.failures++;
    if (this.failures >= this.threshold) {
      this.state = 'open';
      setTimeout(() => this.state = 'half-open', 60000);
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Observability

You can't fix what you can't see. Structured logging, metrics, and traces aren't optional—they're how you understand what's happening in production.

### 3. Graceful Degradation

When a non-critical dependency fails, the system should continue operating with reduced functionality rather than failing entirely.

## Design Patterns That Matter

**Timeouts everywhere**: Every network call needs a timeout. No exceptions.

**Idempotency**: Operations should be safe to retry. Design for at-least-once delivery.

**Health checks**: Deep health checks that actually verify the system can do work, not just that the process is running.

## Conclusion

Reliability is earned through consistent application of patterns, rigorous testing, and learning from incidents. Start with these fundamentals, measure everything, and iterate.
